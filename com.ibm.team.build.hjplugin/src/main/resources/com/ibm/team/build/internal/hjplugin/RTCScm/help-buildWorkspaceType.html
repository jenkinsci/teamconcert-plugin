  <p>
   Selecting a repository workspace will just accept and fetch the change sets from its flow target(s).
  </p>
  <p>
   If you have specific requirements related to how the repository workspace should be
   loaded (example: create component folders, use load rules, delete the sandbox prior to
   loading, etc.), use the option to build from a build definition instead.
