  <p>
   RTC SCM support requires access to a build toolkit on the Node that a build runs on.
   You can configure multiple versions of build toolkits (example: one for RTC 4.0.2 and
   one for RTC 3.0.1.5). Each build installation needs to be given a name to help you
   select the desired toolkit when configuring the global settings, jobs and Slave nodes.
