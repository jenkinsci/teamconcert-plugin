        This feature is useful when implementing a delivery pipeline within Jenkins. When checked, Jenkins will not
        close the <i>RTC Build Result</i> on the server side, allowing subsequent jobs to write content into it and
        change its result.
    </p>
    <p>
        It should be used in conjunction with the boolean property
        <code>com.ibm.rational.connector.hudson.queueOnly</code>
        on the <i>Build Engine</i>, so that builds triggered from the RTC Client also remain open after the respective
        Jenkins build has finished.
    </p>
    <p>
        <i>Notice that a mechanism to close the RTC Build Result in afterwards should be provided. See <a
            href="https://jazz.net/help-dev/clm/topic/com.ibm.team.build.doc/topics/r_completebuild.html">Ant Tasks</a>.</i>
