[.conf-macro .output-inline]#Integrates Jenkins with link:https://jazz.net/products/rational-team-concert/[Rational Team Concert] link:https://jazz.net/products/rational-team-concert/features/scm[source control] and link:https://jazz.net/products/rational-team-concert/features/build[build] using the richer features of the build toolkit instead of the command line.#

With the build toolkit this plugin adds traceability links from a Jenkins build to an RTC build result, workspace and snapshot.  It also publishes links to work items, change sets and file contents captured in the snapshot.  It leverages the current RTC features and workflows that users are already familiar with such as,mails, toaster popups, reporting, dashboards, etc.

[[TeamConcertPlugin-JobConfiguration]]
=== Job Configuration

NOTE: This section shows how to configure Team Concert Plugin in a freestyle job to load source code from RTC SCM.

. Create a new free-style software project and find the *Source Code Management* section.
. Select "Rational Team Concert (RTC)".
. If global connection settings were not configured above or do not apply to this job, then check the *Override global RTC repository
connection* check box and enter the connection settings here.
[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper .confluence-embedded-manual-size]#image:https://wiki.jenkins.io/download/attachments/66847632/jenkins_configure_job_1200_1.png?version=2&modificationDate=1461327544000&api=v2[image,width=794,height=364]#::
. Click the "Test connection" button to verify the repository connection details.
[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper .confluence-embedded-manual-size]#image:https://wiki.jenkins.io/download/attachments/66847632/jenkins_configure_build_tookit_1200_6.png?version=1&modificationDate=1461326078000&api=v2[image,width=796,height=41]#::
. Prior to 1.2.0.0 a job can be configured with RTC SCM only using either a build definition or a repository workspace. From 1.2.0.0 there is support to
configure RTC SCM with a SCM stream or SCM snapshot.

==== Configuring for Build Definition
. To benefit most from the integration between this plugin and RTC Build, select "Build Definition" from the Build Configuration dropdown
and enter a build definition ID. See the link:https://jazz.net/help-dev/clm/index.jsp?re=1&topic=/com.ibm.team.build.doc/topics/c_hudson_overview.html&scope=null[Hudson/Jenkins build engine type] help topic to learn how to create a Jenkins build definition. Follow these steps to setup a Jenkins Build Definition and
Jenkins Job to avoid a catch-22 situation.  A Jenkins job requires a Hudson/Jenkins build definition and a Hudson/Jenkins build definition
requires a Jenkins job.  RTC actually won't let you save the build definition without a job selected. However, Jenkins will let you save a job without a build definition.  So it is important to configure your build definition and job this way.
.. In Jenkins, create the job first using RTC for source control, but
with no build definition. Leave the _Build Definition_ text box blank. 
.. Save the Jenkins Job.
.. In RTC, create a Jenkins build engine that connects to the Jenkins
server. See https://jazz.net/help-dev/clm/topic/com.ibm.team.build.doc/topics/t_hudson_build_eng.html[Creating a build engine]. In RTC, create a build definition that uses the build engine created in step b and select the job created in step a. See link:https://jazz.net/help-dev/clm/topic/com.ibm.team.build.doc/topics/t_hudson_build_def.html[Creating a build definition]
.. Lastly, in Jenkins, open the Jenkins job and set the _Build Definition_ field with the id of the build definition created in step c.
[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper .confluence-embedded-manual-size]#image:https://wiki.jenkins.io/download/attachments/66847632/jenkins_configure_job_1200_2.png?version=1&modificationDate=1461328211000&api=v2[image,width=794,height=119]#::
.. Notice the "Build Configuration" dropdown. This replaces the radio buttons for build definition and build workspace prior to version 1.2.0.0 of the Team Concert Plugin.
.. Click the "Validate" button to verify the RTC build definition exists.

==== Configuring for Repository workspace
. To load a RTC repository workspace into the Jenkins workspace, select "Build Workspace" from the Build Configuration dropdown. See link:https://jazz.net/help-dev/clm/index.jsp?re=1&topic=/com.ibm.team.build.doc/topics/tcreateworkspace.html&scope=null[Dedicated build workspaces] help topic to learn how to create a build workspace.

[%hardbreaks]

==== Configuring for Snapshot
. To load the jenkins build workspace using a snapshot, select "Build napshot" from the Build Configuration dropdown. This configuration is mainly intended to be used in builds that capture the current state of the RTC SCM workspace/stream in a snapshot and start downstream builds that would populate the jenkins build workspace from the snapshot created and passed from the upstream builds.
[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper .confluence-embedded-manual-size]#image:https://wiki.jenkins.io/download/attachments/66847632/jenkins_configure_job_1200_5.png?version=1&modificationDate=1461329608000&api=v2[image,width=794,height=173]#::
NOTE:To start a downstream snapshot build Parameterized Trigger plugin is required.
.  The following steps show how to configure a parent Jenkins job to trigger a downstream Jenkins job. The parent job is configured to use Build Definition, Repository Workspace or SCM stream. The downstream job is configured to use SCM snapshot. The parent job triggers the downstream job, passing a  snapshot UUID that will be used to load the sources.
.. Consider a parent job that is configured to load from a RTC repository workspace. When the build runs, Team Concert Jenkins plugin creates a snapshot on the build workspace. The snapshot uuid is available as the build environment property team_scm_snapshotUUID.
... Add a post build action to trigger parametrized build on other projects.
[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper .confluence-embedded-manual-size]#image:https://wiki.jenkins.io/download/attachments/66847632/jenkins_configure_job_1200_6.png?version=2&modificationDate=1461330328000&api=v2[image,width=794,height=293]#::
.. Configure a downstream snapshot build
... Create a new job and with a string parameter named *rtcBuildSnapshot*. You can use any parameter name for this purpose.

.. Now when an upstream build is started and once it is done it will trigger the downstream build with the UUID of the snapshot created on the workspace. +
[%hardbreaks]
NOTE: Generation of change log and polling is not supported for Snapshot configuration.

==== Configuring for Stream
. To load the jenkins build workspace using a stream, select "Build Stream" from the Build Configuration dropdown.
[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper .confluence-embedded-manual-size]#image:https://wiki.jenkins.io/download/attachments/66847632/jenkins_configure_job_1200_9.png?version=1&modificationDate=1461331347000&api=v2[image,width=794,height=141]#::
. Click the "Validate" button to verify the build stream exists.
. This configuration supports building from the current state of the specified stream.
. Subsequent builds capture the changes made to the stream since the previous build.
. In this configuration change log can be chosen to be generated by comparing the current build with the previous successful build. By default this option is unchecked.
[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper .confluence-embedded-manual-size]#image:https://wiki.jenkins.io/download/attachments/66847632/jenkins_configure_job_1200_10.png?version=1&modificationDate=1461331478000&api=v2[image,width=794,height=316]#::
NOTE: For this configuration the RTC user configured globally or for this job needs to have permission to attach snapshots to a stream.

==== Load Options
In 1.2.0.0 some of the load and accept options that were previously configurable only in RTC build definitions, can now be configured for Repository Workspace, Stream and Snapshot configurations.

. The directory on the build machine under which the repository files will be loaded can be specified.
. Contents of the load directory can be deleted before reloading 
. Load Policy field, added in 1.2.0.4, can be used to configure the components to load. You can either specify the components to load or choose to use a remote load rule file or dynamic load rules, to determine which components to load.
.. Specify which components to load +
.. When specifying components to load you can choose to create folders for components, in which case the load directory would have folders for components at the top level and each of these folders will have the files/folders for that component.
.. You can also choose to exclude some components.

[[TeamConcertPlugin-BuildTriggers]]
=== Build Triggers
==== Triggering builds by polling for changes
When *Poll SCM* is selected, builds will be triggered only if Team Concert Plugin detects *new* changes. The logic for computing of new changes varies for Build Definition, Repository Workspace and Stream configurations. For Build Definition and Repository Workspace, Team Concert Plugin compares the repository workspace against the flow targets. In case of Stream, the snapshot from the *previous* build is compared against the stream. If the previous build does not have a snapshot, then the build previous to that one is considered.

New changes can be any or all of the following +

* Changes in the flow target not present in the repository workspace.
* Changes discarded in the flow target or changes created in the repository workspace, not delivered to the stream.
* Components added in the flow target
* Components removed from the flow target.

To configure polling, +

. Find the *Build Triggers* section.
. Check the *Poll SCM* check box to poll for new changes.
. Enter a schedule.  Click the help button beside the "Schedule" field to get help with the syntax.
. Click the *Save* button to save the settings and return to the job page.

NOTE: For pipeline jobs, set `poll` boolean attribute to true in the `checkout` step, in addition to configuring a polling interval mentioned in the above steps.
[%hardbreaks]

==== Triggering builds on a schedule

You can configure the job to build at a specific time, irrespective of whether there are new changes in the source code. +

. Find the *Build Triggers* section.
. Check the *Build Periodically* check box.
. Enter a schedule.  Click the help button beside the "Schedule" field to get help with the syntax.
. Click the *Save* button to save the settings and return to the job page.

[[TeamConcertPlugin-ConfiguringJenkinsjobforPostBuildDeliverBuildDefinitionconfigurationonly]]
=== Configuring Jenkins job for Post Build Deliver (Build Definition configuration only)

NOTE: From 1.2.0.3, Post Build Deliver is supported for Build Definition configuration. The RTC server version should be 6.0.4 or higher. 

[%hardbreaks]

To configure for Post  Build Deliver,
. Configure the RTC Build Definition with Post Build Deliver configuration.
. In the Jenkins Freestyle job configuration, add the *RTC Post Build Deliver* post build action. Select *Fail on Error*, if you want the build to fail if post build deliver fails.
. In a Pipeline job, add the following snippet before the end of the script to perform post build deliver as the last step of the build.

[[TeamConcertPlugin-GeneratingPipelineSnippetforTeamConcertPluginfromSnippetGenerator]]
=== Generating Pipeline Snippet for Team Concert Plugin from Snippet Generator for RTC SCM and Post Build Deliver

For pipeline jobs, you can generate the snippet for Team Concert Plugin using the Pipeline snippet generator. See the https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/getting-started/#snippet-generator[help documentation] for more information on how to create a snippet. In the snippet generator, 

* For RTC SCM snippet,
** Click the `Sample Step` dropdown and select checkout. Then select `Rational Team 
Concert` from the dropdown. 
*For Post Build Deliver snippet,
** Select `step` in the `Sample Step` dropdown and select `RTC Post Build Deliver`

[%hardbreaks]

[[TeamConcertPlugin-BestPracticesWhenUsingSnippetGenerator]]
=== Best practices when using Snippet Generator

[%hardbreaks]

Remove references to serverURI, credentialsId if you choose to use the Team Concert Plugin's global configuration (in Jenkins->Settings) in your pipeline snippet.

Even if you do not choose to override global configuration for Team Concert Plugin defined in System Settings, the snippet generator will copy the values for *serverUri*, *credentialsId* and *buildtoolkit* copied from the global configuration in the snippet. If you copy this snippet into your pipeline script, it can create maintenance issues when you intend to change the global server URI, credentials and build toolkit. If you intend to use the global settings for RTCScm configuration, then remove
the following attributes in the snippet 

* serverURI
* credentialsId
* timeout
* buildTool
* overrideGlobal

and then copy the resulting snippet into your pipeline script.

[%hardbreaks]

[[TeamConcertPlugin-UsingPipelineScriptFromSCM]]
=== Using Pipeline Script from SCM

Team Concert Plugin supports Pipeline Script from SCM but does not support lightweight checkout. Some of the ways to use this pipeline feature with RTC SCM are captured in https://jazz.net/wiki/bin/view/Main/JenkinsPipelineFromSCM[Using Team Concert Plugin with Pipeline from SCM]

[%hardbreaks]

[[TeamConcertPlugin-Considerationswhenusingdeclarativepipeline]]
==== Considerations when using declarative pipeline

If you are using declarative pipeline, then every `agent` directive will cause a checkout to happen in that agent using the same configuration as Pipeline Script from SCM. When using a build definition, stream or workspace configuration, this will cause an accept to happen in each of those cases, leading to different content being loaded in each agent. In the case of build definition, an additional build result will be created if the build is triggered from Jenkins. This may or may not be what you want. If you want to prevent the extra checkout for every agent directive, add a options directive below the agent directive with the value `skipDefaultCheckout(true)`

....
options {skipDefaultCheckout(true)}
....

[[TeamConcertPlugin-MasterAgentConfiguration]]
=== Master/Agent Configuration

Master and agent configurations are supported by this plugin.  See the Jenkins documentation on link:https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Distributed+builds[distributed builds] for more information.  The RTC build toolkit home path is required for the master to be able to test connections and build artifacts.


. Navigate to the Computer page (Jenkins > Manage Jenkins > Manage Nodes) and click the "New Node" link.
. Enter a name and create a new node.
. In the node configuration page, find the *Node Properties* section and check the *Tool Locations* check box.
. From the list of tool locations, select the build toolkit you want to define for the node, and set the value in the *Home* field.

NOTE: If you do not wish to override the tool location, then Team Concert Plugin will try to locate the toolkit at the same location specified in Global Tool configuration

Build toolkits can also be installed automatically on agents. And labels can be used to match build toolkits to agents.  However, a valid toolkit is required in the master node to perform connection tests to build artifacts and perform polling. +

[[TeamConcertPlugin-RTCLog]]
=== RTC Log

You can capture logs from the Team Concert plugin to debug any problems
that you may encounter.

[[TeamConcertPlugin-ConfiguringJavaLogging]]
==== Configuring Java Logging

. Navigate to the Jenkins Log page (Jenkins > Manage Jenkins > System
Log) and click the *Add new log recorder* button.
. Provide a name, for example *RTC Log* and click the *Add* button to add a logger.
. Enter a logger for `com.ibm.team.build` and set the log level to
*FINER*.
[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:https://wiki.jenkins.io/download/attachments/66847632/jenkins_configure_rtc_log.png?version=3&modificationDate=1391180511000&api=v2[image]#::
. Click the *Save* button.
. Return to this log if a problem is ever experienced using this
plugin.  The log will help to identify the problem.
. Logging on Agents
.. On the agent, while messages are logged at level FINER, the logs never
come back.

[[TeamConcertPlugin-Logginginthebuildconsolelog]]
==== Configuring logging in the build console log

. There is support for a debug flag which will result in the debug
output going into a build's console log
. The environment variable `com.ibm.team.build.debug` with the value
`true` will activate the debug logging on a agent.
. To configure on a single agent with the debug flag for all builds,
.. Go to Jenkins > Manage Jenkins > Manage nodes.
.. Hover over the link of the node to configure. Choose Configure from
the popup context menu.
.. In the Node properties section, select and check the Environment
variables checkbox
.. Click the Add button beside the List of key value pairs.
.. Supply `com.ibm.team.build.debug` as the name and *true* as the value
.. Click the Save button.
. Alternately to configure the debug flag on master and all agents
.. Jenkins > Manage Jenkins > Configure System
.. In the Global Properties section, select and check the Environment
variables checkbox
.. Click the Add button beside the List of key value pairs.
.. Enter `com.ibm.team.build.debug` as the name and *true* as the value
.. Click the Save button.
. To configure debugging for a single job, add `com.ibm.team.build.debug` as a parameter to the job and set its value to `true`.

The debug flag currently only logs information relating to the class
loader setup. The rest of the logic should not be affected by running on
a master or an agent so if you need those logs, consider running on the
master to get the detailed logs.

[[TeamConcertPlugin-Loggingtheversionofbuildtoolkit]]
==== Logging the version of build toolkit

If you have turned on the variable `com.ibm.team.build.debug`, either
through the environment variables or as a job parameter, then the
version of build toolkit used in the master and agent for that build
will appear in the build log.

You should see messages such as the following in the build log.

[source,console-output]
----
Version of build toolkit "<buildtoolkit-name>" on master is "6.0.4".
Version of build toolkit "<buildtoolkit-name>" on "<agent-name>" is "6.0.4".

The following properties can be accesssed as environment variables in the build after Rational Team Concert source control step is completed.

[cols=",",options="header",]
|===
|property |description
|team_scm_changesAccepted |The number of changes accepted or discared
during the build.

|team_scm_snapshotUUID |UUID of the snapshot created after accepting
changes. Not set if no snapshot was created.

|team_scm_workspaceUUID |The UUID of the Repository workspace used in
the build. Only set if the build is using a build definition.

|buildResultUUID |UUID of the build result. Only set if the build is
using a build definition

|RTCBuildResultUUID |UUID of the build result. Only set if the build is
using a build definition

|requestUUID |UUID of the build request. Only set if the build is using
a build definition.

|buildDefinitionId |UUID of the build definition being used by the
build. Only set if the build is using a build definition.

|repositoryAddress |Address of the RTC repository.

|buildEngineId |Name of the build engine associated with the build
request/result (if there is a build result). An RTC build engine is not
actually running, but some ant tasks need the engine id.

|buildEngineHostName |Host name of the Jenkins master or agent that the
build is running on.

RTC), otherwise, not set

|rtcTempRepoWorkspaceName |The name of the temporary Repository
Workspace created during a build using Stream configuration

|rtcTempRepoWorkspaceUUID |The UUID of the temporary Repository
Workspace created during a build using Stream configuration
|===

Apart from these built-in properties, when using Build definition
configuration, all the build properties set in the build definition and
potentially modified when requesting the build will be available as
environment variables in the Jenkins build  after the Team Concert
plugin runs.

[[TeamConcertPlugin-AccessingRTCBuildpropertiesinaFreestylejob]]
=== Accessing RTC properties in a Freestyle job

In a freestyle job, after Team Concert Plugin completes downloading the source code to the Jenkins workspace, you can access the properties exported by Team Concert Plugin with the following syntax.

*On Windows*

`%<propertyname>%`

*On Unix/Linux*

`$propertyname`

Team Concert Plugin exports some standard properties and user defined build properties(only for Build definition configuration). For a list of builtin properties, refer to xref:TeamConcertPlugin-RTCrelatedEnvironmentVariablesavailabletotheBuild[this section].

[[TeamConcertPlugin-AccessingRTCBuildpropertiesinaPipelinejobbeforecheckoutsteprunsonlyforBuilddefinitionconfiguration]]
=== Accessing RTC properties in a Pipeline job before checkout step - Build Definition only

In a build definition configuration, if the Jenkins build is started from RTC, you can access build properties set in the RTC build result in a pipeline build even before the checkout step runs. These properties can be any of the RTC built-in properties set in the build result or user defined build properties.

To access the RTC Build property from a Build Definition, you must create a String parameter in the Jenkins job with the same name as the RTC build property. The actual value will be set by the RTC build result that starts the Jenkins build. You can supply different values to the user defined RTC build properties when requesting the RTC build.

The following built-in properties are available to the Jenkins build even before the checkout step runs.

[cols=",",options="header",]
|===
|property |description
|buildResultUUID |UUID of the build result. Only set if the build is
using a build definition

|requestUUID |UUID of the build request. Only set if the build is using
a build definition.

|buildDefinitionId |UUID of the build definition being used by the
build. Only set if the build is using a build definition.

|repositoryAddress |Address of the RTC repository.

|buildEngineId |Name of the build engine associated with the build
request/result (if there is a build result). An RTC build engine is not
actually running, but some ant tasks need the engine id.

|buildEngineHostName |Host name of the Jenkins master or agent that the
build is running on.

|buildRequesterUserId |User id of the RTC user that requested the build
be started. Only set if the build is using a build definition

|personalBuild |True if the build is a personal build (requested from
RTC), otherwise, not set
|===

For instance, consider the scenario where you want to know if the RTC
build result that started this pipeline build is a personal build or
not.

. First create a Job parameter "personalBuild" type is String in the
Jenkins pipeline job and  set the default value to false.

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper .confluence-embedded-manual-size]#image:https://wiki.jenkins.io/download/attachments/66847632/2-CreateNewStringParameterForPersonalBuild.png?version=1&modificationDate=1559037996000&api=v2[image,height=250]#

{empty}2. Request a personal build in the RTC build definition associated with the Jenkins job.

{empty}3. In your pipeline script, you can check whether the RTC build is a personal build or not as follows

....
if ("${env.personalBuild}" == "true") {
   // Do something } else {   // Do something else}
}
// or

if ("${personalBuild}" == "true") {
   // Do something } else {   // Do something else}
}
....

{empty}4. To access the buildRequesterUserId property in your script, define a new String parameter called "buildRequesterUserId" to the Jenkins job and set the default value to an empty string.

{empty}5. Back in your pipeline script, you can access the property as

....
"${env.buildRequesterUserId}"
// or
"${buildRequesterUserId}"
....

NOTE: This is different from accessing personalBuild property after the checkout step runs. In that case, the personalBuild property will be reset by the checkout step and can be accessed only through the $\{env} variable. Here, the property is set by the RTC when starting the Jenkins build, even before the checkout step runs.


[[TeamConcertPlugin-AccessingRTCEnvironmentVariablesinaPipelineJobaftercheckoutstep]]
=== Accessing RTC Properties in a Pipeline Job after checkout step
Prop
_checkout_ step now returns a map that is populated by Team Concert
plugin. For instance, you can store the return value from the checkout step into the scmvars variable and access them using the syntax
"$\{scmvars.<rtc environment variable>}". For a list of built-in
properties exported to the environment, see
https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Team+Concert+Plugin[this

[[TeamConcertPlugin-AccessingRTCEnvironmentPropertiesUsingEnvObject]]
==== Accessing RTC Properties in a pipeline job using env object

You can access RTC Environment properties after the checkout step runs using the env object. You will need to use workflow-cps plugin version > 2.40. 

As an example, after every checkout, you can save the snapshot UUID value into a separate variable as follows

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]

   // At this point, env contains RTC related environment variables from the first checkout
   def snapshotUUID1 = "${env.team_scm_snapshotUUID}"
   echo "${snapshotUUID1}"

   checkout([$class: 'RTCScm' ....])
   // At this point, env contains RTC related environment variables from the second checkout. The environment variables contributed by the first checkout are overwritten.
   def snapshotUUID2 = "${env.team_scm_snapshotUUID}"
   echo "${snapshotUUID2}"
 }

[%hardbreaks]

[[TeamConcertPlugin-AccessingRTCpropertiesthroughRTCBuildResultActionObject]]
==== Accessing RTC properties through RTCBuildResultAction object

If you are using workflow-cps < 2.40, follow the workaround mentioned
below.

In a pipeline job the environment variables published by the Team
Concert Jenkins plugin is null if the env object is accessed once before
the RTC SCM checkout step. For instance, the following script would
return the UUID of the snapshot published by the Team Concert plugin.

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
node('master') {
    // run teamconcert scm step
    echo "${env.team_scm_snapshotUUID}"
 }
----

But in the script given below the env object is accessed once before
running the checkout step and hence accessing the snapshot UUID from the
env object returns null

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
echo "${env.BUILD_NUMBER}"
node('master') {
    // run teamconcert scm step
    echo "${env.team_scm_snapshotUUID}"
 }
----

Though the Team Concert plugin publishes the environment variables when
checkout is invoked, in pipeline scripts the env object once constructed
is not refreshed with any of the environment variables, published later.

If you run into issues accessing the environment variables published by
the Team Concert plugin, the suggested work around is to access the
RTCBuildResultAction object that is added to the build by the Team
Concert plugin. The following code returns the build properties stored
in RTCBuildResultAction object. This can be used in a pipeline script to
obtain snapshot UUID.

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
def action = currentBuild.build().getAction(com.ibm.team.build.internal.hjplugin.RTCBuildResultAction.class)
def buildProps = action.getBuildProperties()
println(buildProps['team_scm_snapshotUUID'])
----

If you invoke RTC SCM multiple times, then there will
be that many RTCBuildResultActions in the build. Therefore,
currentBuild.build().getActions(com.ibm.team.build.internal.hjplugin.RTCBuildResultAction.class)
should be used. The action added by the last invocation of RTC SCM
should be available at the end of the list. For instance, if there are
two RTCScm checkouts, the second RTCBuildResultAction can be accessed as
follows.

 
[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
def actions = currentBuild.build().getActions(com.ibm.team.build.internal.hjplugin.RTCBuildResultAction.class)
def buildProps = actions.get(1).getBuildProperties()
println(buildProps['team_scm_snapshotUUID'])
----

NOTE: Your Jenkins administrator should whitelist these methods to access them in a pipeline script. You should consider adding these methods to Global Shared Library. This is explained in the next section. 

[[TeamConcertPlugin-WrappingthecodeinaGlobalSharedLibrary]]
===== Wrapping the code to access RTCBuildResultAction in a Global Shared Library

The above code cannot be directly used in a pipeline script without an administrator whitelisting the APIs in Jenkins. You can wrap this code inside a method and add it to a Global Shared Library. You can then call the method from your pipeline script.

If you are already using a Global Shared Library in your environment,
add the following code in a file called rtcutils.groovy and place the
file under the *vars* directory,

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
 def getSnapshotUUID(actionNum) { // The n'th RTCBuildResultAction.
    def actions = currentBuild.build().getActions(com.ibm.team.build.internal.hjplugin.RTCBuildResultAction.class)
    if (actions != null && actions.size() > 0 && actionNum > 0 && actionNum <= actions.size()) {
        def buildProps = actions.get(actionNum-1).getBuildProperties()
        return (buildProps['team_scm_snapshotUUID'])
    } 
    return null
}
----

Then, in your pipeline script, you can write the following to get the
snapshotUUID of the checkout step.

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
@Library('your-shared-library')_

node {
   checkout([$class: 'RTCScm'...])

   // pass 2 or greater if the shared library is fetched from RTC, otherwise pass 1.
   // If the library is fetched from RTC, then there is one RTCBuildResultAction corresponding to that checkout. 
   // Hence you need to pass 2 or more depending on how many EWM (RTC) checkouts have been called after @Library directive.
   def snapshotUUID = rtcutils.getSnapshotUUID(2)
   echo "${snapshotUUID}"
}
----

If you do not have Global Shared Library that is defined in your environment, see https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries[Extending with Shared Libraries] for creating and accessing a shared library in your pipeline script. Note that if you use RTC for hosting the Global Shared Library, then there will be a checkout of the source code from RTC. A RTCBuildResultAction will be added to  the build at the point where the library is checked out into the pipeline script.

[[TeamConcertPlugin-SymbolicLinksupport]]
=== Symbolic Link support

NOTE: Symbolic links works out of the box from Java version 7 and greater. The following information is retained for older Java versions.

RTC support for symbolic links requires one or two additional libraries
(.dll/.so files).

. RTC file system natives
. Eclipse file system natives

The reason is Java 6 and earlier doesn't have support for
creating/looking at properties of symbolic links. Java 7 has symbolic
link support that works on linux, but on Windows there are some
limitations when creating links (if the target has not yet been created
the type is defaulted to file which is not good if its a directory). If
you are running Linux and can use Java 7 you only need the Eclipse
natives. Otherwise, you will need both the RTC and Eclipse natives.

In the Build engine directory (<your RTC build install
directory>\buildengine\eclipse\plugins), look for (or equivalent jars
for your platform/release).

. `com.ibm.team.filesystem.client_3.1.600.v20130415_0257.jar` (RTC
file system natives)
. `org.eclipse.core.filesystem.win32.x86_1.1.201.R36x_v20100727-0745.jar`
(Eclipse file system natives)

From the com.ibm.team.filesystem.client jar you want to extract
`+winfsnatives.dll+` (`+libfsnatives.so+` on linux). Take all the
.dll/.so files from the org.eclipse.core.filesystem jar. Place them
directly in a directory (eg. c:\natives\winfsnatives.dll).

When you start Jenkins, we need to tell java about the directory so that
it can load the libraries from it. To this, you can add the directory to
the search path. +

Change the `PATH` variable on Windows or the `+LD_LIBRARY_PATH+`
variable on linux prior to starting Jenkins. Alternatively, you can also
specify it when starting Java through the `+-Djava.library.path+`
setting. +
eg.

`java -Djava.library.path="c:\natives;%Path%" -jar jenkins-1.509.1.war`

If you are running on Windows, you need to be sure that you have
permission to create symbolic links. The
https://jazz.net/library/article/970/[Symbolic links article] in the
jazz.net library describes how.

NOTE: If you are running your jenkins builds on agents and the symbolic
links fail to load, then the native libraries should be included in the
JVM library path of the agents too.

[[TeamConcertPlugin-LoadRulesSupport]]
=== Load Rules Support

. When a jenkins build is configured with an RTC build definition, the
component load rules specified in the RTC build definition, if any, will
be applied when loading the jenkins build
workspace. https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSCP65_6.0.3/com.ibm.team.build.doc/topics/r_scm_build_loadrules.html[Component
load rules in builds] describes how to specify load rules in a build
definition.
. When a jenkins build is configured with an RTC repository workspace,
stream, or snapshot load rules can be specified by setting the load
policy field to "Load components by using a load rule file".
 [.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper .confluence-embedded-manual-size]#image:https://wiki.jenkins.io/download/attachments/66847632/Load-Using-Load-Rule-File.png?version=1&modificationDate=1512376770000&api=v2[image,height=250]#
. To configure load policy in a pipeline build, set the "loadPolicy"
field to one of - "useComponentLoadConfig", "useLoadRules", or
"useDynamicLoadRules".
.. When loadPolicy is set to useComponentLoadConfig, you can either
choose to load all components or exclude some components by setting the
value for "componentLoadConfig" to either "loadAllComponents" or
"excludeSomeComponents".
. The load policy field for RTC build definition can be set only using
the 6.0.5 RTC client.
. Component load rules can also be specified through dynamic load rules
extension. For more details refer to
https://jazz.net/wiki/bin/view/Main/DynamicLoadRulesJenkinsPlugin[DynamicLoadRulesJenkinsPlugin].
Dynamic load rules feature is supported across all build configurations
- build definition, repository workspace, stream, and snapshot.
. In build definition configuration, when load rules are configured in
the build definition and dynamic load rules are also provided, dynamic
load rules take precedence over the component load rules.

==== Load Rules behaviour in Team Concert Plugin version >= 1.2.0.4

From 1.2.0.4, the behavior of load rules in Jenkins builds
is at par with RTC SCM (in Eclipse client or SCM CLI). So, only those components for which load rules are specified will be loaded, according to those rules; all the other
components for which load rules are not specified will not be loaded. To
maintain backwards compatibility in Jenkins builds configured with an RTC
build definition, old load rules behavior will be enforced unless the
load policy field in the build definition is set to use load rules. You can change the load policy by migrating your old build definitions from the Eclipse client to use the new load format.

==== Load Rules behaviour in Team Concert Plugin version < 1.2.0.4
Before 1.2.0.4, the behavior of load rules in Jenkins
builds, when using the component load rules specified in RTC build
definition or the load rules generated by the dynamic load rules
extension, is different from how eclipse client enforces the load rules.
Say, you have a load rules file that loads some but not all of the
components in a workspace. This load rules file when used to load a
workspace in the eclipse client, will result in loading of only those
components specified in the load rules file. When the same load rules
file is configured in an RTC build definition, all components from the
workspace, including those not specified in the load rules file, are
loaded; those components for which load rules are specified are loaded
according to the specified load rules, all the other components are
loaded as is. `Components to exclude`
option, in the RTC build definition can be used to restrict which
components are loaded during the build - for more details refer
https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSCP65_6.0.3/com.ibm.team.build.doc/topics/tcreatebuilddefinition.html[Creating
RTC build definitions].

[[TeamConcertPlugin-AdvancedPipelineCapabilities]]
=== Advanced Pipeline capabilities

==== Perform polling only and generate changelog while skipping downloading the sources in the Jenkins build

You can configure a pipeline job to poll on a RTC build definition or a repository workspace but skip downloading the sources when the pipeline build runs by using the option polling-only. 
Optionally, you can provide a snapshotUUID to generate a changelog for the Jenkins build. The snapshot should be owned by the repository workspace configured in the build definition.

To enable the polling-only option, add the text "pollingOnly: true" to the checkout step. If you prefer to use the snippet generator to generate a checkout step with the polling-only option, follow the steps below:

. Open the Jenkins Web UI.
. Navigate to the pipeline job.
. In the left pane, click "Pipeline Syntax".
. Under Steps, select checkout from the Sample Step dropdown list.
. Under SCM, Select Rational Team Concert (RTC).
. Change the Build Configuration to Build Definition or Repository Workspace.
. For Build Definition configuration, enter the ID of the Build Definition.
. For Repository workspace configuration, enter the name of the Repository Workspace.
. Click Advanced.
. Select "Perform polling but do not accept or load the repository workspace.
. To generate a changelog, enter the variable that references the snapshot UUID. For example, ${ret.snapshotUUID}.
.. To retrieve Jazz SCM snapshot details from the build result, use the "Get SCM Snapshot" task.
. Click Generate Pipeline script.

NOTE: All values in the generated script are enclosed in single quotes. If single quotes are used, then a value like ${ret.buildResultUUID} is interpreted literally by the pipeline build. To expand such values, modify the script to enclose the value within double quotes, for example "${ret.snapshotUUID}".

==== rtcBuild Step

rtcBuild is a pipeline step to interact with RTC Build from a pipeline job. The step provides the following tasks

* Request Build
* Wait for Build 
* List logs
* List artifacts
* Download log
* Download artifact

===== Request build

To request a RTC build from a pipeline job, use the "Request Build" task. Once the build request is successfully created, the step returns the build result UUID in an object that is available in pipeline script. To retrieve the build result UUID from the object, use the syntax ${obj.buildResultUUID}, where obj is the name of the object.

To generate the pipeline snippet for requesting a build, perform the following steps

. Open the Jenkins Web UI.
. Navigate to the pipeline job.
. In the left pane, click "Pipeline Syntax"
. Under Steps, select rtcbuild from the Sample Step dropdown list.
. Select a Build toolkit. 
. Enter a value for RTC server URI or accept the default.
. Select the appropriate credentials or accept the default.
. Select "Request Build" from the Task dropdown list.
. Enter a Build Definition ID.
. To delete properties while requesting a build, check "Delete Properties".
.. Click "Add Property" and enter the name of the property to delete.
. To add a new property or override the value of an existing property when requesting a build, select "Add or Override Properties".
.. Click "Add Property" and add the name and value of the property to add to or override in the build request.
. To insert a link of the build result associated with the build request to the Jenkins pipeline build, select "Insert EWM(RTC) build link to Jenkins pipeline build"".
. Click Generate Pipeline Script.

NOTE: All values in the generated script are enclosed in single quotes. If single quotes are used, then a value like ${ret.buildResultUUID} is interpreted literally by the pipeline build. To expand such values, modify the script to enclose the value within double quotes, for example "${ret.buildResultUUID}".

The following snippet requests a build and prints the build result UUID after the step completes requesting a build in RTC

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
def ret = rtcBuild buildTool: '<builtoolkit-name>', credentialsId: '<credentials>', serverURI: '<rtc-server-uri>', task: [buildDefinitionId: '<build-definition-id>', name: 'requestBuild'], timeout: 480], timeout: 480
  echo "${ret.buildResultUUID}"
----

The following snippet requests a build with one new property and a few deleted properties and prints the build result UUID after rtcBuild step completes requesting a build in RTC.

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
  def ret = rtcBuild buildTool: '<builtoolkit-name>', credentialsId: '<credentials>', serverURI: '<rtc-server-uri>', task: [buildDefinitionId: '<build-definition-id>', name: 'requestBuild',
  addOrOverrideProperties: true, propertiesToAddOrOverride: [[propertyName: 'addProp', propertyValue: 'newValue']], 
  propertiesToDelete: [[propertyName: 'deleteProp1'], [propertyName:'deleteProp2']]
 ], timeout: 480], timeout: 480
  echo "${ret.buildResultUUID}"
----

The following snippet requests a build, prints the build result UUID after rtcBuild step completes requesting a build in RTC and adds a link of the build result to the Jenkins pipeline build.

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
  def ret = rtcBuild buildTool: '<builtoolkit-name>', credentialsId: '<credentials>', serverURI: '<rtc-server-uri>', task: [buildDefinitionId: '<build-definition-id>', name: 'requestBuild',  
linkEWMBuild: true], timeout: 480], timeout: 480
  echo "${ret.buildResultUUID}"
----

===== Wait for Build

To make the pipeline build pause until a RTC build to change state or a timeout expires, use the Wait for Build task. Once the step completes successfully, one of the following is true:

* The timeout has expired.
* The RTC build has reached one of the required states.

The following argument must be provided for waiting on a build.

* Build result UUID.

The following arguments are optional.

* Build states to wait for
** The different states of the build result on which the step will wait. If the build result enters into one of the states, then the step returns from execution.
   By default, the step does not complete until the build result enters the COMPLETED or INCOMLPETE state. The build enters an INCOMPLETE state when it is abandoned.
* Wait Timeout
** The time in seconds up to which this step will wait. By default, the step waits forever to reach the specified build states. 
   For longer builds, it is recommended to wait for a shorter timeout and use looping constructs available in pipeline script to retry.

The step returns the following values.

* The status of the build - either OK, ERROR, WARNING, or INFO.
* The state of the build - either COMPLETE, INCOMPLETE, IN_PROGRESS, CANCELED, or NOT_STARTED.
* Whether or not the step timed out. If this value is false, then the status of the build is one of the build states that the step waited on.

To generate the pipeline snippet for waiting on a build, perform the following tasks

. Open the Jenkins Web UI.
. Navigate to the pipeline job.
. In the left pane, click "Pipeline Syntax".
. Under Steps, select rtcBuild from the sample step dropdown list.
. Select a Build toolkit. 
. Enter a value for RTC server URI or accept the default.
. Select the appropriate credentials or accept the default.
. In the Task dropdown list, select "Wait for Build".
. In the Build Result UUID text box, enter a value. This value is usually a parameter which is obtained from requesting a build. For example, to refer to the build result UUID obtained from a "Request Build" task, enter ${ret.buildResultUUID}.
. In the Build States to wait for text box, enter the states to wait for separated by a comma. The default values are COMPLETED and INCOMPLETED. Other values are IN_PROGRESS, CANCELED, and NOT_STARTED.
. In Wait timeout (in seconds) text box, enter the wait timeout in seconds. This value should be greater than zero. The default value is -1 which makes the step wait until the build result enters into the specified states. 
. Click Generate Pipeline Script.

NOTE: All values in the generated script are enclosed in single quotes. If single quotes are used, then a value like ${ret.buildResultUUID} is interpreted literally by the pipeline build. To expand such values, modify the script to enclose the value within double quotes, for example "${ret.buildResultUUID}".

In the following snippet, the "Wait for Build" task uses the build result UUID from "Request Build" task to wait for the build result to enter into COMPLETED or INCOMPLETE state for 120 seconds. Once the step completes, it prints the following fields from the return value. 

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
* buildState
* buildStaus
* timedout

  def ret2 = rtcBuild buildTool: '<builtoolkit-name>', credentialsId: '<credentials>', serverURI: '<rtc-server-uri>', task: [buildResultUUID: "${ret.buildResultUUID}", name: 'waitForBuild', buildStates: 'COMPLETED,INCOMPLETE,CANCELED', waitBuildTimeout: 120], timeout: 480
  echo "${ret2.buildState}"
  echo "${ret2.buildStatus}"
  echo "${ret2.timedout}"
----

===== List Logs

Use the "List Logs" task to retrieve the details of the logs from an EWM build result. Logs appear in the "Logs" tab of the EWM build result. 

NOTE: The content of the log can be stored in the EWM repository or in some external storage. This task will retrieve the details of the logs whose content is stored in the EWM repository. Such logs can be uploaded to the build result using the logPublisher ant task in the EWM build toolkit. https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/elm/7.0.2?topic=contributions-logpublisher[Log Publisher]

To generate the pipeline snippet for list logs from an EWM build result, perform the following steps

. Open the Jenkins Web UI.
. Navigate to the pipeline job.
. In the left pane, click "Pipeline Syntax".
. Under Steps, select rtcBuild from the sample step dropdown list.
. Select a Build toolkit. 
. Enter a value for RTC server URI or accept the default.
. Select the appropriate credentials or accept the default.
. In the Task dropdown list, select "List Logs".
. In the Build Result UUID text box, enter a value. This value is usually a parameter which is obtained from requesting a build. For example, to refer to the build result UUID obtained from a "Request Build" task, enter ${ret.buildResultUUID}. This is a mandatory parameter.
NOTE: Remember to quote ${ret.buildResultUUID} once the snippet is copied to the pipeline script.
. In the File name or pattern text box, enter a file name or pattern to restrict the logs for which details will be retrieved. If no value is specified, then details of all the logs whose content is stored in EWM repository will be retrieved. This parameter is optional.
. In the Component name text box, enter the name of the component to restrict the logs for which details will be retrieved. If no value is specified, then details of all the logs belongining to any component or no component will be retrieved. To retrieve details of logs that does not belong to any component, leave this field blank. This parameter is optional.
. In the Maximum number of results text box, enter the maximum number of logs for which details will be reterieved. The default value is 512, largest value is 2048. If there are more than 2048 logs in the build result, restrict the result set by providing a file name pattern or component name. 
. Click Generate Pipeline Script.

NOTE: All values in the generated script are enclosed in single quotes. If single quotes are used, then a value like ${ret.buildResultUUID} is interpreted literally by the pipeline build. To expand such values, modify the script to enclose the value within double quotes, for example "${ret.buildResultUUID}".

Once the step completes execution, you can access the information about each log using a for loop.

===== List Artifacts

Use the "List Artifacts" task to retrieve the details of the artifacts from an EWM build result. Artifacts appear in the "Downloads" tab of the EWM build result. 

NOTE: The content of the artifact can be stored in the EWM repository or in some external storage. This task will retrieve the details of the artifacts whose content is stored in the EWM repository. Such artifacts can be uploaded to the build result using the artifactFilePublisher ant task in the EWM build toolkit. https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/elm/7.0.2?topic=contributions-artifactfilepublisher[Artifact Publisher]

To generate the pipeline snippet for list logs from an EWM build result, perform the following steps

. Open the Jenkins Web UI.
. Navigate to the pipeline job.
. In the left pane, click "Pipeline Syntax".
. Under Steps, select rtcBuild from the sample step dropdown list.
. Select a Build toolkit. 
. Enter a value for RTC server URI or accept the default.
. Select the appropriate credentials or accept the default.
. In the Task dropdown list, select "List artifacts".
. In the Build Result UUID text box, enter a value. This value is usually a parameter which is obtained from requesting a build. For example, to refer to the build result UUID obtained from a "Request Build" task, enter ${ret.buildResultUUID}. This parameter is mandatory.
NOTE: Remember to quote ${ret.buildResultUUID} once the snippet is copied to the pipeline script.
. In the File name or pattern text box, enter a file name or pattern to restrict the artifacts for which details will be retrieved. If no value is specified, then details of all the artifacts whose content is stored in EWM repository will be retrieved. This parameter is optional.

===== Download Log

To download a log from the build result, use the "Download log" task. You can download a log using the log's name or content ID. 

If you do not know the full name of the log when creating the script, you can retrieve details of all the logs starting with a specific prefix using the "List logs" task. Then, you can use the content id or the file name to download the contents of the log to the Jenkins workspace or any folder in the agent where this task runs.

NOTE: The content of the log can be stored in the EWM repository or in some external storage. This task will download the content of a log which is stored in the EWM repository. Such logs can be uploaded to the build result using the logPublisher ant task in the EWM build toolkit. This task is similar to the logRetriever ant task in the EWM build toolkit.  Refer to https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/elm/7.0.2?topic=contributions-logpublisher[Log Publisher] and https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/elm/7.0.2?topic=contributions-logretriever[Log Retriever].

To generate the pipeline snippet for download log from an EWM build result, perform the following steps

. Open the Jenkins Web UI.
. Navigate to the pipeline job.
. In the left pane, click "Pipeline Syntax".
. Under Steps, select rtcBuild from the sample step dropdown list.
. Select a Build toolkit. 
. Enter a value for RTC server URI or accept the default.
. Select the appropriate credentials or accept the default.
. In the Task dropdown list, select "Download log".
. In the Build Result UUID text box, enter a value. This value is usually a parameter which is obtained from requesting a build. For example, to refer to the build result UUID obtained from a "Request Build" task, enter ${ret.buildResultUUID}. This parameter is mandatory.
NOTE: Remember to quote ${ret.buildResultUUID} once the snippet is copied to the pipeline script.
. In the File name text box, enter the full name of the log. If the full name of the log is not known at the time of writing the script (for example, the log's name has a timestamp as a suffix), then use the list logs task to retrieve details of all logs matching a file name pattern and provide the file name attribute as a reference, for example ${ret2.fileName}. If more than one log matches the given file name, then the first match is downloaded. If it is possible for logs to have the same name, then use the content ID attribute as a reference, for example ${ret2.contentId}. Either File Name or Content ID parameters must be provided but not both. 
. In the Component name text box, enter the name of the component to which this log belongs to. If there are multiple logs with the same name across different components, then providing the component name will download the log under the specific component. This parameter is optional.
. In the Content Id field, provide a reference to the contentId attribute from the return value of List logs task. Either File Name or Content ID parameters must be provided but not both.
. In the Destination file name text box, provide a name for the file to which the contents will be downloaded to. If a file with the same name already exists in the destination, then a  file will be created by appending the destination file name with the current timestamp.  This parameter is optional.

NOTE: All values in the generated script are enclosed in single quotes. If single quotes are used, then a value like ${ret.buildResultUUID} is interpreted literally by the pipeline build. To expand such values, modify the script to enclose the value within double quotes, for example "${ret.buildResultUUID}".

Once the step completes execution, you can access the following fields about the downloaded log.

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]

===== Download Artifact

To download an artifact from the build result, use the "Download artifact" task. You can download an artifact using its name or content ID. 

If you do not know the full name of the artifact when creating the script, you can retrieve details of all the artifacts starting with a specific prefix using the "List artifact" task. Then, you can use the content id or the file name to download the contents of the artifact to the Jenkins workspace or any folder in the agent where this task runs.

===== Get SCM Snapshot

Retrieve the Jazz SCM snapshot details for a given EWM (RTC) build result.

If the build result has a Jazz SCM snapshot contribution, then the task returns the snapshot's name and UUID.
If the build result does not have such a contribution, then the task returns empty values for snapshot name and UUID. 
This task does not check the state of the build result to see if it is in progress while the task runs. It is left to the caller to ensure that a snapshot has been added to the build result before the task runs. You can use the Wait for build task to wait for a specific amount of time or change of state and then call this task to retrieve snapshot details.

To generate the pipeline snippet for the "Get SCM Snapshot" task, perform the following steps

. Open the Jenkins Web UI.
. Navigate to the pipeline job.
. In the left pane, click "Pipeline Syntax".
. Under Steps, select rtcBuild from the sample step dropdown list.
. Select a Build toolkit. 
. Enter a value for RTC server URI or accept the default.
. Select the appropriate credentials or accept the default.
. In the Task dropdown list, select "Get SCM Snapshot".
. In the Build Result UUID text box, enter a value. This value is usually a parameter which is obtained from requesting a build. For example, to refer to the build result UUID obtained from a "Request Build" task, enter ${ret.buildResultUUID}. This parameter is mandatory.

NOTE: All values in the generated script are enclosed in single quotes. If single quotes are used, then a value like ${ret.buildResultUUID} is interpreted literally by the pipeline build. To expand such values, modify the script to enclose the value within double quotes, for example "${ret.buildResultUUID}".

Once the step completes execution, you can access the following fields about the Jazz SCM snapshot.

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
* snapshotName - The name of the Jazz SCM snapshot.
* snapshotUUID - The UUID for the Jazz SCM UUID. 
----

===== Accessing Jenkins build parameters and groovy variables in steps

To access a Jenkins build parameter in place of string value in a pipeline script, use the syntax 

----
"${env.parameter_name}". 
----

The presence of double quotes in the script will cause the groovy interpreter to perform string interpolation.

To access a groovy variable in place of string value in a pipeline script, use the syntax "{$var}". If the variable is an object and you need to use the value of one of the fields of the object, use the syntax 

----
"${var.field_name}"
----

===== Known caveats with download log or artifact into the jenkins workspace on an agent

In a pipeline build , if the option "Use groovy sandbox" is unchecked, then Jenkins does not allocate the workspace directory when the build starts. If an attempt is made to create a file or a folder under the workspace directory, it fails since the workspace directory does not exist.

If you use the "Download Log" or "Downalod Artifact" task to download a file into the Jenkins workspace, you must create the workspace directory before running the task. The following snippet shows how to create the workspace directory if it doesn't exist and then create a subdirectory under the workspace directory to store the logs and artifacts.

----
    def workspace = "${env.WORKSPACE}"
    echo "${workspace}"
    withEnv(["workspace=${workspace}"]) {
        sh '''
        echo "${workspace}"
        if [ ! -e ${workspace} ]; then
          mkdir -p "${workspace}"
        fi
        '''
    }
    dir('') {
     // Switch to the directory to download the log or artifact
    }

----

===== Publishing downloaded log or artifact to the Jenkins build

To publish the downloaded log or artifact to the Jenkins build, use the "archiveArtifacts" step. The following snippet publishes all files with the .log extension to the Jenkins build.

----

archiveArtifacts artifacts: '*.log', followSymlinks: false

** See Work Item 461859: Make the "creation of Jenkins build links to work items in accepted change sets" an opt - in for the users in Repository Workspace and Stream configuration.
* We have fixed an incompatibility with Pipeline jobs wherein messages from Team Concert Plugin were not printed in the build log.

=== 1.2.0.5 June 15, 2018

Important information : The minimum required version of Jenkins is now
1.625.1. After upgrade, it is recommended to check that the Team Concert
plugin (RTCScm) configuration is intact in a few jobs.

* In repository workspace and stream build configuration, plugin now
creates links to the Jenkins build in the work items attached to the
change sets
** See WorkItem 388795: In Team Concert Jenkins Plugin, when using build
workspace/stream configuration, create backlinks in included work item
(s) to the Jenkins build
* You can view the version of build toolkit used in master and agent in
the build log by adding com.ibm.team.build.debug = true to the
environment or as a job parameter.
** See WorkItem 449539: [Jenkins] Log the version of build toolkit in

. Support for Jenkins credentials has been added which introduced a
dependency on the
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Credentials+Plugin[Credentials
plugin]. If a job is already configured to use user ID and password (or
password file) , it will continue to run but these fields are read only.
Any changes will require credentials going forward.  Using the
Credentials plugin offers more flexibility and solves some issues.
.. Multiple credentials can be defined and used in multiple jobs
.. Can use a global user ID and password (or password file) when the RTC
URL is overridden
https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-21537[issue 21537]

item 306172]
. When builds are started within RTC, the server will manage the
lifecycle of the build result by periodically polling Jenkins to
determine if the build is completed. With RTC 5.0, build definitions
support the boolean property
`com.ibm.rational.connector.hudson.queueOnly`. When used in
conjunction with this release of the plugin, the plugin will terminate
the RTC build result when the build completes (just as it does when the
build is started in Jenkins). If a lot of builds are started from within
RTC, this will be more efficient. Requires RTC version 5.0 or later.
https://jazz.net/jazz/resource/itemName/com.ibm.team.workitem.WorkItem/308749[Work

. New option to use rest service calls to communicate with the RTC
Server when performing configuration, polling and build result
management (as opposed to the build toolkit). This means if all the jobs
have this configured and run on agents, the toolkit classes will not be

is required. The password can be supplied directly or it can be placed
in a

. The RTC build toolkit is used perform build related tasks within
Jenkins master and agent processes (as opposed to using a command line client). The RTC related tasks include validating the configuration,
polling and working with the RTC build result as well as performing the Accept and Checkout phases of the build.
. Support for a simple build workspace

. The environment variable buildResultUUID is a parameter that is
supplied to the Jenkins job when the build started from RTC. It was
sometimes also being updated (contributed by this plugin) even if the
build was started in Jenkins. In order to better support building
multiple projects with the Multiple SCM plugin, the environment variable
will not be updated by this plugin. The build result UUID is still
available from the RTCBuildResultUUID regardless of where the build was
started from.

. Jenkins
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Credentials+Plugin[Credentials
Plugin] is now used for storing the user ID and password. For an
existing global configuration and jobs, the user ID and password (or
password file) fields will be read-only. If a job is using a password
file and needs to change a password, the password file contents can be
replaced. Otherwise, to update the password the job will need to start
using credentials. If this not acceptable, the plugin can work in the
old mode by setting the system/environment property:
com.ibm.team.build.credential.edit=true.

. On Linux, a build definition with a load directory starting with "/"
(i.e. "/any/folder") used to be interpreted as a relative path, but is
now correctly interpreted as an absolute path.  So, any build definition
relying on the previous behavior need only prefix the load directory
with a "." (i.e. "./any/folder").
